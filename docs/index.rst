Subduce Documentation
===================================

Subduce is a small, dynamically typed, functional programming language based on python and racket (specifically advanced student language). I'd always wanted to make a programming language, and in the summer of 2019, I thought I was finally ready to give it a shot. I didn't any real education in programming languages, so this language isn't very sophisticated. However, I had a great time making it and it was a very good learning experience.

This was my first programming language and, after learning a lot more since I've implemented it, I've seen a lot of ways I could improve the implementation and design of the language. I plan on making a similar, more ML-like language in the future in a language like OCaml or F#. I think the ability to easy create union types and the support for recursion and functional style will make the implementation much smoother. After seeing the beauty of algebraic types and pattern matching, it's hard to go back to making 10 files and a visitor every time I want a union type!
