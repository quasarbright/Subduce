Subduce
===================================

Subduce is a small, dynamically typed, functional programming language based on python and racket (specifically advanced student language). I'd always wanted to make a programming language, and in the summer of 2019, I thought I was finally ready to give it a shot. I didn't have any real education in programming languages at the time, so this language isn't very sophisticated. Despite that, I had a great time making it and it was a very good learning experience.

This was my first programming language and, after learning a lot more since I've implemented it, I've seen a lot of ways I could improve the implementation and design of the language. I plan on making a similar, more ML-like language in the future implemented in something like OCaml or F#. I think algebraic types and the support for recursion and functional style will make the implementation much smoother.
